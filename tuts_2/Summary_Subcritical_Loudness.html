    <h1>Study Summary: Loudness of Subcritical Bandwidth Sounds</h1>
    <p class="meta-info"><strong>Paper:</strong> Loudness of sounds with a subcritical bandwidth: improved prediction with the concept of tonal loudness<br>
    <strong>Authors:</strong> Sottek, Lobato, & Becker (2022)</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <h3>The Core Problem</h3>
        <p>Standard loudness models (ISO 532-1/3) assume that for **subcritical bandwidth** signals (very narrow sounds), loudness depends only on the sound level, regardless of how narrow the signal is. However, experimental data shows this is false: narrow, tonal sounds are perceived as significantly louder than the models predict. This paper proposes an improvement based on separating Tonal Loudness from Noise Loudness.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Methodology: The Sottek Hearing Model (SHM) Improvement</h2>
    
    <h3>A. The Problem Data</h3>
    <p>The authors analyzed published listening tests (including their own and those by Hots et al.) where subjects matched the loudness of a pure tone against a noise band of varying narrowness (subcritical bandwidth). The data consistently showed that models *overestimated* the loudness of noise and *underestimated* the loudness of pure tones, indicating a flaw in how the models calculate spectral summation for highly concentrated energy.</p>

    <h3>B. SHM Modification (ECMA 418-2)</h3>
    <p>The core innovation of the Sottek Hearing Model (SHM) is the formal separation of the signal within the auditory filter bank into two components:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Specific Tonal Loudness</strong> (the perceived strength of tonal components).</li>
        <li><strong>Specific Noise Loudness</strong> (the perceived strength of non-tonal components).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This allows the model to apply a non-linear weighting function (Equation 1, involving power averaging) where the Tonal Loudness can have a disproportionately stronger influence on the final overall loudness. </p>

    <h3>C. Protocol for Model Comparison</h3>
    <p>The modified SHM was tested against original experimental loudness matching data for **subcritical bandwidth noise** at different center frequencies and levels (30 dB, 50 dB, 70 dB).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Models Compared:</strong> SHM (new method) vs. ISO 532-1 (Zwicker) and ISO 532-3 (Moore-Glasberg-Schlittenlacher).</li>
        <li><strong>Finding:</strong> SHM accurately matched the experimental tendency (showing a decline in perceived loudness as bandwidth increases), while ISO 532 models severely overestimated the loudness of the noise across all conditions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Key Findings and Conclusion</h2>

    <h3>A. Validation of Tonal Loudness Concept</h3>
    <p>The study confirms that loudness perception is not simply about energy within a critical band, but about the **type** of energy (tonal vs. noise). By combining tonal and noise loudness non-linearly, SHM solves the long-standing problem of predicting loudness for narrow-band and tonal signals.</p>

    <h3>B. Model Superiority</h3>
    <p>The ability of the SHM (ECMA 418-2) to accurately track the experimental data for subcritical bandwidths demonstrates its **superiority** for narrow-band and tonal signal evaluation, highlighting the severe prediction gap in the current ISO standards (which fail to incorporate this concept). The authors conclude that this model is now fit to calculate **Tonal Loudness** (as distinct from Tonal Prominence).</p>

    <div class="jargon-section">
        <div class="jargon-term">Subcritical Bandwidth</div>
        <div class="jargon-def">
            A specialized noise signal whose frequency bandwidth is narrower than the ear's critical filter (critical band). Loudness estimation in this range is a major challenge for older loudness models.
        </div>

        <div class="jargon-term">Tonal Loudness vs. Noise Loudness</div>
        <div class="jargon-def">
            The fundamental distinction made by the SHM. Tonal Loudness is the part of perception related to pure tones (whines, whistles), which the brain amplifies disproportionately, while Noise Loudness is the background hiss or broadband sound component.
        </div>

        <div class="jargon-term">Critical Band / Auditory Filter Bank</div>
        <div class="jargon-def">
            The mathematical model representing the frequency-selective filters in the inner ear (cochlea). It separates incoming sound into different frequency channels.
        </div>

        <div class="jargon-term">Autocorrelation Function</div>
        <div class="jargon-def">
            A mathematical tool used within the SHM to identify and separate the repeating, periodic tonal components from the random, non-repeating noise components within a specific frequency band.
