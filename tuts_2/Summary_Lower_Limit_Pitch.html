    <h1>Study Summary: The Lower Limit of Pitch Perception</h1>
    <p class="meta-info"><strong>Paper:</strong> The Lower Limit of Pitch Perception for Pure Tones and Low-Frequency Complex Sounds<br>
    <strong>Authors:</strong> Jurado, Larrea, & Moore (2021)</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <h3>The Core Question</h3>
        <p>What is the absolute lowest repetition rate (frequency) at which the human auditory system can no longer perceive a clear **pitch** (a tone) and instead hears only **fluctuation** (a rumble)? This defines the hard limit for the auditory system's periodicity analysis.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Methodology and Test Protocol</h2>
    
    <h3>A. Stimuli Design</h3>
    <p>The study used three different stimulus types, all with low repetition rates (3 Hz to 40 Hz), to determine the Overall Lower Limit of Pitch (OLLP):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pure Tones:</strong> Single, resolved frequency components.</li>
        <li><strong>Sinusoidally Amplitude-Modulated (SAM) Tones:</strong> Complex sounds with an amplitude envelope repeating at the test rate.</li>
        <li><strong>Tone-Pip Trains:</strong> Sequences of short, distinct tone pulses repeating at the test rate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Protocol & Subjects</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Subjects:</strong> 8 participants with normal hearing and normal low-frequency sensitivity.</li>
        <li><strong>Task:</strong> **Adaptive 1-up 1-down procedure**. Subjects were instructed to focus on the "tonal" or "humming-like" quality. If they heard a tone, the frequency was decreased for the next trial; otherwise, it was increased.</li>
        <li><strong>Goal:</strong> The test converged on the lowest frequency where a tonal quality was consistently heard (the OLLP).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Key Findings and Conclusion</h2>
    
    <h3>A. The Hard Limit of Pitch</h3>
    <p>The study found that the lower limit of pitch perception is remarkably low and consistent across different types of sounds. </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Average LLP:</strong> The overall average LLP across all conditions was approximately **19 Hz**.</li>
        <li><strong>Time Interval:</strong> This 19 Hz frequency limit corresponds to a **time interval of approximately 53 milliseconds (ms)**.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>B. Pitch is Determined by Repetition Rate (Temporal Code)</h3>
    <p>The LLP was found to be similar across all three stimulus types (pure tones, SAM tones, and tone pips), even though they had fundamentally different spectral structures (some were single resolved harmonics, others were unresolved complex sounds).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Pitch perception for very low frequencies is determined primarily by the **repetition period of the waveform or the envelope**, rather than the spectral content. The auditory system has a "clock" that cannot accurately measure time intervals longer than 53 ms to derive a pitch.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>C. Relevance to Other Fields</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The OLLP of 19 Hz matches the transition point found in studies of Auditory Evoked Fields (AEF), suggesting this 53 ms interval is a fundamental physiological limit in the **auditory cortex**.</li>
        <li>The lowest fundamental frequencies of almost all common musical instruments (pianos, clarinets, etc.) are **above** this 19 Hz limit, suggesting the range was biologically optimized for pitch perception.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="jargon-section">
        <div class="jargon-term">Lower Limit of Pitch (LLP)</div>
        <div class="jargon-def">
            The lowest frequency (repetition rate) at which a sound is perceived as having a clear pitch (a tone). Below this limit, the sound is perceived as a fluctuating rumble.
        </div>

        <div class="jargon-term">Periodicity Analysis</div>
        <div class="jargon-def">
            The mechanism in the auditory system responsible for extracting the repetition rate of a sound to determine its pitch. This process has a temporal limitation (around 53 ms).
        </div>

        <div class="jargon-term">Resolved / Unresolved Harmonics</div>
        <div class="jargon-def">
            **Resolved:** Harmonics that are far enough apart in frequency to stimulate separate auditory filters in the inner ear. **Unresolved:** Harmonics that are so close they fall into the same filter and are merged by the ear.
        </div>

        <div class="jargon-term">Sinusoidally Amplitude-Modulated (SAM) Tones</div>
        <div class="jargon-def">
            A test signal where a carrier tone (125 Hz) has its volume fluctuating rhythmically (the envelope) at the test rate (e.g., 19 Hz).
