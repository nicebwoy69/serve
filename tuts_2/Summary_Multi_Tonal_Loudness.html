    <h1>Study Summary: Modeling Perceived Tonal Loudness</h1>
    <p class="meta-info"><strong>Paper:</strong> Modeling the perceived tonal loudness of multiple tonal components<br>
    <strong>Authors:</strong> Lobato & Sottek (2023)</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <h3>The Core Question</h3>
        <p>How does the loudness of complex tones (multiple harmonics or partials) change when a single component is altered? This study tests the accuracy of the Sottek Hearing Model's Tonal Loudness component against empirical data from listening tests involving multi-tone signals.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Methodology and Test Protocol</h2>
    
    <h3>A. Models and Structure</h3>
    <p>The core model under investigation is the **Sottek Hearing Model (SHM)**, standardized in ECMA 418-2, which separates sound into tonal and noise components. The calculation steps involve filtering, auditory bank analysis, and specific weighing of the separated components. </p>
    
    <h3>B. Listening Test Design</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Subjects:</strong> 16 participants with self-reported normal hearing.</li>
        <li><strong>Task:</strong> Loudness Matching (Method of Adjustment). Subjects adjusted a slider to make a modified complex tone sound equally loud as the original reference tone.</li>
        <li><strong>Stimuli:</strong> Harmonic complex tones with fundamental frequencies (f0) of 700 Hz and 1000 Hz. The number of harmonics was varied (2 or 4).</li>
        <li><strong>Key Manipulation:</strong> The amplitude of only **one harmonic** was changed (e.g., multiplied by a factor of 3x or 9x, corresponding to a level increase of 9.5 dB or 19 dB).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Statistical Methods</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Measured the **Level Difference at Equally Perceived Loudness** (dB).</li>
        <li><strong>Bayesian Framework:</strong> Applied **Bayes' rule** to the results to increase robustness, calculating the probability of the *parameters given the experimental data* ($P(\mu,\sigma|E)$), which is more reliable for small sample sizes than traditional statistics.</li>
        <li><strong>Metric:</strong> Calculated the **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** to compare the error of the three models.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Key Findings and Model Comparison</h2>

    <p>The study compared the Sottek Hearing Model's tonal loudness calculation (Tonal Loudness) against the overall loudness prediction of the older ISO 532-1 and ISO 532-3 standards. </p>
    
    <h3>A. Model Agreement on Tonal Loudness</h3>
    <p>For the core tests (multi-tone signals with altered amplitude), the predictions of all three models fell largely within the 95% credible interval of the listening experiment. This suggests that all three models can generally handle the spectral summation effects of multi-tone complexes well.</p>

    <h3>B. Superior Accuracy of SHM</h3>
    <p>When evaluated using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the models ranked as follows (lower error is better):</p>
    <div class="table-container">
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Method</th>
                    <th>Mean Absolute Error [dB]</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Sottek Hearing Model</strong></td>
                    <td><strong>0.60 dB</strong></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>ISO 532-3</td>
                    <td>0.69 dB</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>ISO 532-1</td>
                    <td>0.77 dB</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>
    <p>The Sottek Hearing Model (ECMA 418-2) showed the lowest error, making it the most accurate predictor for these multi-tone signals.</p>

    <h3>C. Tonality Metric Shortcoming</h3>
    <p>The paper noted that while **SHM Tonal Loudness** is excellent, the older **SHM Tonality** *metric* (which estimates the prominence of a tone, not its loudness) fails for signals with multiple prominent components because it was designed only for a single dominant tone.</p>
    
    <h3>D. Conclusion</h3>
    <p>The Tonal Loudness component of the Sottek Hearing Model accurately predicts the perceived loudness of complex multi-tone signals and is slightly superior to the current ISO standards. This confirms the model's strength in handling signals with complex spectral content.</p>
