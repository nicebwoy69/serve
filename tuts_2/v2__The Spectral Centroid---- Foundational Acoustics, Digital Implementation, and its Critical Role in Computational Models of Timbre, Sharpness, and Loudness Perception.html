            <p class="mb-4">The analysis of complex soundwaves, particularly musical tones, requires sophisticated metrics that bridge the physical domain of frequency and amplitude with the subjective domain of human hearing perception. Among these metrics, the Spectral Centroid (SC) stands out as an indispensable tool in digital signal processing (DSP) and psychoacoustics. It provides a highly effective, scalar description of the overall shape of an audio signal's frequency spectrum.<sup class="text-red-500">1</sup></p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                Timbre, often described as the quality that allows two sounds of the same pitch, loudness, and duration to be distinguished, is fundamentally multidimensional.<sup class="text-red-500">2</sup>
                Timbre perception relies on a complex interplay of steady-state spectral properties and time-varying features, collectively described by the sound's temporal envelope and its spectral distribution.<sup class="text-red-500">3</sup>
                The Spectral Centroid is consistently recognized as a primary acoustic correlate of the <em>brightness dimension</em> of timbre, while the time course of the signal's amplitude envelope (e.g. attack time or attack temporal centroid) captures a complementary temporal dimension.<sup class="text-red-500">2</sup>

            <h3 class="text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">I.B. The Spectral Centroid (SC) as a First-Order Spectral Moment</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">The Spectral Centroid characterizes the spectrum by indicating its center of mass, or center of gravity.<sup class="text-red-500">6</sup> This calculation provides a simple, yet powerful, quantification of how the power is distributed across the frequency axis.<sup class="text-red-500">8</sup> Because the vast majority of audible power in a sound is typically concentrated in the lower frequencies, the SC value represents the balance point of the spectrum. When sound energy is concentrated in high frequencies, the SC value shifts upward; conversely, concentration in low frequencies results in a low SC value.<sup class="text-red-500">1</sup></p>
            <p class="mb-4">Crucially, the Spectral Centroid has a robust and empirically validated connection with the impression of brightness of a sound.<sup class="text-red-500">6</sup> Sounds with a high SC are perceived as bright (e.g., a struck cymbal or the nasal vowel 'ee'), while sounds with a low SC are perceived as dark or muffled (e.g., a sine wave or the vowel 'oo').<sup class="text-red-500">8</sup> This inherent perceptual correlation underpins its widespread application in music information retrieval (MIR) and computational psychoacoustics.<sup class="text-red-500">10</sup></p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                The significance of the SC for research focusing on loudness perception is not direct but hierarchical, established through the psychoacoustic model of Sharpness. The flow of influence is best understood as a <strong>conceptual chain</strong> that moves from acoustic description to perceptual attributes and then to formal psychoacoustic metrics and loudness-related quantities:

            </div>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Sharpness, a fundamental psychoacoustic metric, is formally defined as the subjective attribute describing the perception of spectral balance.<sup class="text-red-500">11</sup>
                It is often interpreted as a <em>perceptual analogue</em> of a spectral centroid, transforming a description of spectral energy distribution into a metric scaled according to the human auditory system's sensitivity.<sup class="text-red-500">11</sup>
                Modern loudness standards (e.g. ISO 532-1) compute a frequency-dependent specific loudness pattern (Specific Loudness), from which both total loudness and Sharpness are derived. In this sense, acoustic descriptors such as the Spectral Centroid provide concise summaries of the spectral shape that, after auditory filtering and compression, help determine the specific loudness pattern used in comprehensive loudness models.

            <p class="mb-4">The Spectral Centroid is a mathematical statistic&mdash;the first moment, or mean&mdash;applied to the frequency spectrum of an audio signal. Its calculation requires segmenting the signal, applying a Fourier transform, and then calculating a weighted average.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">In DSP applications, the audio signal is divided into short-time frames, and the spectrum is typically computed using the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). The centroid is then calculated per frame, treating the spectral data as a normalized distribution over the frequency bins.<sup class="text-red-500">14</sup></p>
            <p class="mb-4">The standard discrete formula for the Spectral Centroid ($\text{SC}[t]$ at time frame $t$) is given by the ratio of the weighted frequency sum to the unweighted amplitude sum:</p>

            <h3 class="text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">II.C. Implementation Nuances: Magnitude vs. Power Spectrum</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The choice of the spectral value $s_k$ is a critical implementation detail. Both the magnitude spectrum ($|X(k)|$) and the power spectrum ($|X(k)|^2$ or $P_k$) are commonly used as weights.<sup class="text-red-500">10</sup>
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1 mb-4">
                <li><strong>Magnitude Spectrum:</strong> Using the linear magnitude places less weight on very high-amplitude harmonics.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Power Spectrum:</strong> Using the power spectrum ($P_k = |X(k)|^2$) squares the weights.
                    This non-linearity disproportionately emphasizes high-energy partials, and when higher-frequency components are already relatively strong, it can result in a calculated centroid that is higher than one derived from the magnitude spectrum.
                    This often yields a slightly stronger empirical correlation with subjective perceived brightness.<sup class="text-red-500">16</sup>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-4">
                A common variation found in computational libraries uses bin indices ($m$) and the sampling rate ($f_s$) for simplified frequency calculation, assuming $M$ is the total number of FFT bins:
            </p>
            <div class="text-center overflow-x-auto">
                $$f_{centroid} = \frac{f_s}{2(M-1)} \cdot \frac{\sum_{m=0}^{M-1} X_p[m] \cdot m}{\sum_{m=0}^{M-1} X_p[m]}$$
            </div>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Where $X_p[m]$ is the power spectrum magnitude at bin $m$.<sup class="text-red-500">16</sup>
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The mathematical necessity of the denominator ($\sum s_k$) is profound: it serves as a normalization factor. By dividing the weighted sum by the total spectral energy, the resulting Spectral Centroid characterizes the spectral shape (or timbre) independently of the overall signal level (or loudness).<sup class="text-red-500">14</sup>
                If the denominator were omitted, the result would simply be proportional to the total energy, reducing the SC to a redundant measure heavily confounded by amplitude.
                The normalization ensures the SC functions specifically as a standardized descriptor of timbral quality.

            <p class="mb-4">Accurate calculation of the Spectral Centroid requires careful consideration of the preparatory steps inherent to the STFT process, particularly the choice of windowing function and frame parameters.</p>

            <h3 class="text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">III.A. Prerequisites: STFT, Windowing, and Frequency Resolution</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Spectral Centroid computation relies on dividing the continuous audio signal into short, usually overlapping, temporal windows.<sup class="text-red-500">1</sup> This allows the measurement to capture the time-varying nature of the spectrum.</p>

            <h4 class="text-base sm:text-lg font-medium text-gray-600 mt-4 mb-2">III.A.i. Windowing Function Choice</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">Before the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is applied to each frame, a windowing function (such as Hamming or Hanning) must be applied. This window serves to taper the start and end of the frame, minimizing spectral leakage&mdash;the phenomenon where energy from a specific frequency component "leaks" into adjacent frequency bins.<sup class="text-red-500">18</sup> The selection of a window is a trade-off: minimizing side lobes (to reduce leakage) typically increases the width of the main lobe, decreasing overall frequency resolution.<sup class="text-red-500">18</sup> For high-accuracy spectral centroid estimation, particularly in differentiating closely spaced harmonics, the window function choice is critical.</p>

            <h4 class="text-base sm:text-lg font-medium text-gray-600 mt-4 mb-2">III.A.ii. Frame Size and Temporal Trajectories</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">The size and overlap of the analysis window critically influence the resulting SC estimate. Increasing the window length generally increases the robustness of the power spectrum and SC estimates, thereby lowering variance.<sup class="text-red-500">19</sup> However, this improvement in robustness comes at the cost of temporal resolution: analyzing non-stationary segments (like musical transients) with long windows introduces bias because the spectral content changes significantly within the frame duration.<sup class="text-red-500">19</sup></p>
            <p class="mb-4">The utility of SC in characterizing sound dynamics rests on its temporal resolution. For musical tones, the sound is often divided into thousands of frames, each lasting a few milliseconds.<sup class="text-red-500">20</sup> Average frame durations are typically around 50–60 milliseconds, but to accurately capture rapid changes in spectral energy distribution during the initial attack phase&mdash;where spectral content often jumps to higher frequencies before settling&mdash;much shorter frames may be necessary.<sup class="text-red-500">1</sup> This temporal evolution, or SC trajectory, is crucial for synthesizing realistic instrument sounds and is an essential perceptual cue.<sup class="text-red-500">3</sup></p>

            <h3 class="text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">III.B. Step-by-Step Worked Example (Numerical Demonstration)</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">To illustrate the calculation and interpretation of the Spectral Centroid, consider a synthetic complex tone comprising a fundamental frequency ($F_0$) and two higher harmonics. Assume a simplified, idealized spectrum where the total energy is concentrated at these three frequencies, and the power spectrum ($P_k$) is used as the weighting function ($s_k$).</p>

            <p class="mt-4"><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The resulting Spectral Centroid of $287.5 \text{ Hz}$ is higher than the fundamental frequency ($200 \text{ Hz}$).

            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1 mb-4">
                <li><strong>Spectral Spread (Variance):</strong> The second moment, measuring the average deviation of energy around the Spectral Centroid.<sup class="text-red-500">24</sup> This parameter is commonly associated with the bandwidth or complexity of the signal.<sup class="text-red-500">3</sup></li>
                <li><strong>Spectral Skewness (Tilt):</strong> The third moment, indicating the symmetry of the spectrum around the mean.<sup class="text-red-500">13</sup> In speech analysis, this is sometimes referred to as spectral tilt.<sup class="text-red-500">10</sup> For harmonic signals, skewness reveals the relative strength of lower versus higher harmonics.</li>

            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1 mb-4">
                <li><strong>Timbre Discrimination and Identification:</strong> SC is a dominant feature for distinguishing and identifying instrument timbres.<sup class="text-red-500">10</sup> Studies have shown that when SC is manipulated (spectral tilting), listeners’ ability to discriminate sounds and identify the instrument source is significantly impaired.<sup class="text-red-500">13</sup> This high perceptual sensitivity to SC changes confirms its importance in sound source categorization.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamics and Spectral Tilt:</strong> A common observation across many acoustic instruments is that an increase in playing dynamics (e.g., piano to forte) leads to a higher calculated SC.<sup class="text-red-500">1</sup> This is because increased energy input often results in stronger high-frequency partials relative to the fundamental, shifting the center of spectral mass upwards. Consequently, increasing the Spectral Centroid can be used in synthesis to simulate dynamic variation, especially in instruments with a limited physical dynamic range.<sup class="text-red-500">1</sup></li>
                <li><strong>Pitch Correlation:</strong> For musical tones, SC frequently covaries positively with the fundamental frequency ($F_0$); that is, a higher pitched note played on the same instrument will generally exhibit a somewhat higher SC.<sup class="text-red-500">8</sup> This correlation introduces a potential confound in psychoacoustic studies, necessitating a determination of whether perceived brightness is absolute or relative to pitch. Empirical research suggests that the raw SC value is a better predictor of perceived brightness than the SC scaled by $F_0$.<sup class="text-red-500">8</sup></li>

            <p class="mb-4">While the steady-state SC defines the overall timbre quality, the analysis of the SC trajectory over time is crucial for modeling non-stationary musical events. Specifically, the rapid shift in SC during the onset, or attack phase, provides essential information for sound identification.<sup class="text-red-500">21</sup></p>
            <p class="mb-4">Recent psychoacoustic analyses have moved beyond simple measures of attack time toward the attack temporal centroid&mdash;a derived feature that integrates temporal and spectral energy changes.<sup class="text-red-500">5</sup> Meta-analyses have indicated that the attack temporal centroid often possesses greater overall explanatory power for perceptual dimensions than attack time alone.<sup class="text-red-500">5</sup> This highlights that for sophisticated timbre analysis, capturing the instantaneous rate of change in SC ($\text{dSC}/\text{dt}$) is as important as the average SC value. The need for high-resolution temporal analysis confirms that the dynamic perception of timbre is fundamentally dependent on the time-varying nature of the spectral envelope.</p>

                V. The Spectral Centroid and Research on Loudness Perception (The Critical Nexus)
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The user's research focus on loudness perception requires a formal connection between the acoustic Spectral Centroid (SC) and the established psychoacoustic models of loudness, which are standardized by bodies such as ISO (e.g., ISO 532-1:2017, the Zwicker Method).<sup class="text-red-500">28</sup>
                This link is mediated by the derived metric of Sharpness and, more fundamentally, by the specific loudness pattern that underlies both Sharpness and total loudness.

            <p class="mb-4">
                Loudness modeling is predicated on accurately simulating the filtering, non-linear compression, and integration processes of the human ear, particularly through the use of critical bands (Bark scale).<sup class="text-red-500">29</sup>
                The initial analysis of the acoustic signal generates a specific loudness pattern ($N'$), which is the loudness density measured across the critical band rate $z$.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The Spectral Centroid is calculated in the physical domain (Hz) using the raw magnitude or power spectrum.
                To connect this to perception, the analysis must transition to the perceptual domain (Bark).<sup class="text-red-500">11</sup>
                The overall distribution of energy across frequency—of which the SC is a compact summary—strongly influences how much energy falls into higher critical bands and thus helps shape the specific loudness pattern $N'(z)$.

                V.C. Sharpness Calculation using Specific Loudness (Zwicker/Fastl Model)
            </h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The standardized calculation for Sharpness, derived from the models of Zwicker and Fastl, formally treats Sharpness as a weighted barycenter of the Specific Loudness ($N'$) across the critical band rate ($z$).<sup class="text-red-500">11</sup>
                This is structurally similar to the Spectral Centroid calculation, but operates on the perceptually weighted Specific Loudness spectrum instead of the raw acoustic power spectrum.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">The Sharpness formula ($S$) is given as:</p>
            <div class="text-center overflow-x-auto">
                $$S = c \cdot \frac{\int_{0}^{24 \text{ Bark}} N'(z) g(z) z \, dz}{\int_{0}^{24 \text{ Bark}} N'(z) \, dz}$$

                </li>
                <li>
                    $z$: The critical band rate (in Bark), spanning the audible frequency range (0 to 24 Bark).<sup class="text-red-500">31</sup>
                </li>
                <li>
                    $g(z)$: A non-linear, frequency-dependent weighting function. This function drastically increases the influence of high frequencies (typically above $3000 \text{ Hz}$ or $16 \text{ Bark}$), formalizing the auditory system's heightened sensitivity to high-frequency energy when assessing brightness and related attributes.<sup class="text-red-500">11</sup>
                </li>
                <li>

                The structural similarity of the Sharpness formula to the SC formula motivates the common interpretation of Sharpness as a <em>psychoacoustic centroid</em> computed over specific loudness on the Bark scale: it measures the mean position of spectral energy, but within the auditory model.

            <p class="mb-4">
                The denominator of the Sharpness equation is the formal definition of Total Loudness ($N$) of the sound, measured in Sone:<sup class="text-red-500">29</sup>
            </p>
            <div class="text-center overflow-x-auto">
                $$N = \int_{0}^{24 \text{ Bark}} N'(z) \, dz$$
            </div>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Modern loudness calculation methods (such as ISO 532-1) require calculating the specific loudness pattern $N'(z)$, which serves as the foundation for both Total Loudness ($N$) via integration and Sharpness ($S$) via the weighted centroid calculation.<sup class="text-red-500">28</sup>
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The critical relationship is therefore: the acoustic spectrum (summarized in part by the Spectral Centroid) describes the distribution of energy across frequency. This distribution, filtered through the human hearing model, gives rise to the specific loudness pattern $N'(z)$.
                The Sharpness ($S$) is the perceptual center of gravity of $N'(z)$.
                Consequently, spectra whose energy is biased toward higher frequencies (and which therefore tend to have higher SC values) will generally produce specific loudness patterns that are weighted toward higher critical bands and, in turn, higher Sharpness $S$.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">V.E. Implications for Loudness Research</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The primary utility of SC/Sharpness in loudness research is the ability to deconstruct how spectral content influences perception beyond mere energetic magnitude.
                Sounds can possess equal total loudness ($N$) but drastically different perceived qualities due to their spectral shape.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The presence of the $g(z)$ weighting function in the Sharpness model introduces a critical non-linearity absent in the raw SC calculation.
                This function emphasizes that a slight increase in high-frequency energy in the upper audible range will have a disproportionately large effect on perceived Sharpness, formalizing the finding that the auditory system is hypersensitive to high-frequency energy when assessing spectral tilt.
                Researchers studying loudness must account for this non-linear emphasis, as high Sharpness can lead to increased perceived annoyance or different masking effects, even if the total energy remains constant.<sup class="text-red-500">13</sup>

            <p class="mb-4">
                The Spectral Centroid is an essential feature for characterizing audio signals. Mathematically defined as the weighted mean of the frequency spectrum, it is a robust, normalized measure of spectral shape, directly correlating with the perceptual attribute of brightness. Its power lies in its ability to quantify the relative distribution of energy across frequency components, independent of overall amplitude. For researchers focused on loudness perception, the SC's greatest relevance is its close, systematically modeled relationship with the psychoacoustic parameter of Sharpness. Sharpness can be viewed as a perceptually weighted centroid calculated within the human hearing model, using Specific Loudness across the Bark scale. Understanding how spectral energy distributions summarized by the raw acoustic SC are transformed by the auditory model into the non-linearly weighted Sharpness calculation is paramount for creating accurate and perceptually valid models of time-varying loudness and sound quality.

            <h3 class="text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">VI.C. Recommendations for Future Loudness Research Integration</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Based on the established link between acoustic SC and psychoacoustic Sharpness, the following integration points are recommended for advanced research in loudness perception:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-3">
                <li><strong>Dual Trajectory Analysis:</strong> When analyzing time-varying sounds, it is recommended to simultaneously calculate the raw acoustic SC trajectory (in Hz) and the derived Sharpness trajectory ($S$ versus time, in acum).<sup class="text-red-500">11</sup> By comparing these two trajectories, researchers can isolate and quantify the non-linear effects introduced by the human auditory model&mdash;specifically, the psychoacoustic emphasis provided by the $g(z)$ weighting function&mdash;on the perceived center of spectral mass.</li>
                <li><strong>Transients and Temporal Psychoacoustics:</strong> Given the importance of the SC trajectory during the attack phase, research should focus on how rapid, instantaneous changes in SC (high $\text{dSC}/\text{dt}$) modulate subsequent temporal psychoacoustic parameters. Changes in SC during the onset are known to influence identification and discrimination <sup class="text-red-500">20</sup>; these rapid spectral changes are expected to interact dynamically with temporal factors such as Roughness and Fluctuation Strength, which are critical components of perceived time-varying loudness.</li>
                <li><strong>Spectral Moment Integration:</strong> To move beyond simple brightness quantification, the SC should be systematically integrated with its co-descriptors, particularly Spectral Spread and Skewness.<sup class="text-red-500">25</sup> These features provide a more complete mathematical description of the spectral envelope, allowing for more nuanced modeling of how spectral complexity influences masking and the overall specific loudness pattern $N'(z)$, thereby yielding superior predictive power for total loudness ($N$) in complex environments.</li>
