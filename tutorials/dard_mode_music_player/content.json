    "In this tutorial, you’ll learn five core UI design principles—Color, Typography & Baseline, Grid Systems & Layout, Gestalt & Spacing—and then apply them in a final “music-player” dashboard mockup. You’ll work in Inkscape on a 1920×1080 dark-charcoal document. By the end, you’ll have a perfectly aligned, neon-blue–accented playback interface with a volume knob, fader, and glow effects. Each part uses a set of locked PNG guides (color palette, baseline grid, column grid) plus transparent UI asset packs.",
